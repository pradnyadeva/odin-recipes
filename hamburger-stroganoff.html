    <h1>Hamburger Stroganoff Recipe:</h1>
    <img src="stroganoff.jpeg" alt="stroganoff-img" style="width:400px;height:250px;">
    <p>I created this hamburger stroganoff as an amalgamation of about a half-dozen stroganoff recipes. Really hits the spot on a cold day, served over egg noodles with peas and carrots.</p>

    <h2>Ingridients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package sliced white mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>  
        <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>    
        <li>1 cup red wine</li>    
        <li>1 cup beef stock</li>   
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>    
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>    
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li> 
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li> 
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef, mushrooms, and onion. Cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Transfer mixture to a bowl. Add garlic and oil to the skillet; saute until garlic is golden brown, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Turn skillet heat to high; add red wine and beef stock. Bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Reduce heat and simmer until flavors meld, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk sour cream and cornstarch together in a bowl. Mix into the wine/broth mixture. Stir in the browned beef mixture. Bring to a simmer, stirring frequently. Add salt and pepper.
        </li>
    </ol>
